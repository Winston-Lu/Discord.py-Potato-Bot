# Discord.py-Potato-Bot

A bot for Discord written in Python 3.8 as a general purpose utility bot. This bot was meant to replace my original discord.py bot after the Discord.py rewrite.

## Features
Music player

Image manipulation

Chat clearing/restore

Games

## Credit
For music integration, I used code from [vbe0201's example here](https://gist.github.com/vbe0201/ade9b80f2d3b64643d854938d40a0a2d), with a bit of modification to get some commands to work and edit the error messages
